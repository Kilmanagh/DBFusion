# DBFusion

DBFusion is an all-in-one database wrapper, middleware, and interface for .NET applications. It allows developers to access and interact with databases without changing their application code, making it easy to switch between different database types or work with multiple databases simultaneously.

## Features

- **Unified Database Interface:** Access various databases through a single, consistent API.
- **Database Agnostic:** Easily switch between different database engines (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) without code changes.
- **Multi-Database Support:** Connect and operate on multiple databases, even if they are different types.
- **Middleware Layer:** Abstracts database logic, simplifying migrations and integrations.
- **Seamless Integration:** Drop-in replacement for direct database access in your .NET projects.
